Exercise 1:

	use: grep; also use pipes
	
	prepare env: cd ~ && mkdir -p exercise/1 && sudo cp /var/log/syslog exercises/1/syslog && cd exercise/1 && pwd
	
	task: count all entries in the syslog file between July 10 and July 19 that contain the word kernel AND the word error (both case insensitive!) but NOT the word dbus
	
	solution: grep -E '^Jul\s[1-2][0-9]' /var/log/messages | grep -i kernel | grep -i error | grep -v -i dbus


Exercise 2:

	use: grep, cut, sort, uniq; also use pipes

	prepare env: cd ~ && mkdir -p exercise/2 && cd exercise/2 && wget http://84.200.12.217/access.log && pwd

	task: show all files that have been accessed on July 20th on this web server, sort them alphabetically and make sure there are no duplicates
		
	solution: grep "20/Jul" access.log | cut -d " " -f 7 | sort | uniq
	


Exercise 3:
	
	use: grep, sed, sort; also use redirects & pipes
	
	prepare env: cd ~ && mkdir -p exercise/3 && cp /etc/services exercise/3/services && cd exercise/3 && pwd

	task: create a new file that has no comments except if they start with "# private", no blank lines, and is ordered by the portnumber!
	
	additional task: switch the columns so that portnumber is first (use cut, paste)

	solution: grep -E '^[a-z 0-9]|^#\ private|^#[a-z]' services | sed 's/# private/#private/g' | sort -k2 -n | sed 's/#private/# private/g'| less
